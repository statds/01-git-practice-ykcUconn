Paragraph withou a hard break
I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans.

This is an example of short line
"Recover the accidently removed file add.qmd; add a long line (a paragraph without a hard break)"
